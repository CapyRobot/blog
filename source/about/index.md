I am [Eduardo Rocha](https://www.rocha.one/), currently a Senior System Software Engineer working at Nvidia on Autonomous Vehicles. I like to write about topics I find interesting and that I think could help someone else; no particular focus besides being related to robotics or software engineering.

Looking to bring fresh perspectives and insights to the table, delving into under-explored topics and providing unique, actionable information.

Random, but useful, stuff.
